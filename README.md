## Plans for Improving the Project

While the current version of the website meets the project requirements, there are several potential improvements that could enhance its functionality and user experience:

1. Implement a dark mode toggle: Add a feature that allows users to switch between light and dark color schemes, improving readability and reducing eye strain in low-light conditions.

2. Create a gallery section: Showcase high-quality images of the coffee shop interior, baristas at work, and featured menu items to give visitors a better sense of the atmosphere and offerings.

3. Add a reviews section: Incorporate customer testimonials or integrate with a review platform to display real customer feedback, building trust with potential customers.

4. Implement a simple online ordering system: Allow customers to place orders for pickup, enhancing the convenience factor for regular patrons.

5. Create a blog section: Regularly update with articles about coffee brewing techniques, bean origins, or local events to keep the content fresh and engage with the community.

These improvements would not only make the website more functional but also demonstrate a deeper understanding of user needs and modern web development practices.
